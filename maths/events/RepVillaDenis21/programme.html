<ul>
<li><b>Robert Boltje</b> [UC Santa Cruz]<br>
    <em>Titel:</em> <b>The trivial source ring, coherent characters, and orthogonal units</b>
    <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>:</em> 
       Trivial source modules of a finite group \(G\) over a field \(F\) of characteristic \(p>0\) are direct summands of finite-dimensional permutation \(FG\)-modules. Their isomorphism classes form a monoid under the direct sum and tensor product operations. The associated Grothendieck ring is called the trivial source ring, \(T(FG)\). We give a description of the trivial source ring as a subring of a product of character rings. This allows us to characterize the group of orthogonal units (or equivalently, torsion units) of \(T(FG)\) as a direct product of two subgroups. The first factor is the unit group of the Burnside ring of the \(p\)-fusion system of \(G\), and the second factor consists of "coherent" linear characters on normalizers of \(p\)-subgroups. The main motivation of studying the torsion unit group of \(T(FG)\) is its connection with the group of \(p\)-permutation self-equivalences of \(FG\). This is joint work with Robert Carman.

 <li><b>Thomas Breuer</b> [RWTH Aachen]<br>
    <em>Titel:</em> <b>Compute reductions of character values to finite fields, or avoid this.</b>
     <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>: </em>
       Several representation theoretic questions involve the reduction of (Brauer) character values to finite fields. I will talk about technical subtleties of some of these questions.
    </div><br>
    </li>   
<li><b>Olivier Dudas</b> [Universit&eacute; de Paris]<br>
    <em>Titel:</em> <b>Braid group actions for Deligne--Lusztig varieties</b>
    <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>:</em> (Joint work in progress with C. Bonnaf&eacute;, M. Brou&eacute;, G. Malle, J. Michel, R. Rouquier)<br>
        The irreducible characters of a finite reductive group \(G(q)\) (such as \(GL(n,q)\) or \(S0(n,q)\) are constructed using algebraic varieties attached to the elements of the Weyl group of \(G\), or even to the elements of its braid group. In this talk I will explain how one can also construct interesting braid group actions on these varieties or at least on their cohomology, extending work of Brou&eacute;-Michel. I will show some rather strange properties of this action, and explain how it can be used to recover Lusztig's exotic Fourier transform.
      </div><br></li>      
<li><b>Jonas Hetz</b> [Universit&auml;t Stuttgart]<br>
    <em>Title:</em> <b>Unipotent character sheaves and character values of finite groups of Lie type</b>
    <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>:</em> 
    Let \(G\) be a finite group of Lie type. In order to tackle the problem of determining the character table of \(G\), Lusztig developed the theory of character sheaves. In this framework, one has to find the transformation between two bases of the space of class functions on \(G\), one of them consisting of the irreducible characters, the other one of characteristic functions of Frobenius-invariant character sheaves. We will indicate how this problem can in principle be reduced to considering cuspidal character sheaves of (quasi-)simple groups and report on some recent progress in this area.

<li><b>Birte Johansson</b> [TU Kaiserslautern]<br>
    <em>Titel:</em> <b>On the inductive condition for the McKay--Navarro conjecture for the Suzuki and Ree groups</b>
    <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>:</em> 
     Navarro's refinement of the McKay conjecture claims that the bijection from the McKay conjecture can be chosen such that it is equivariant under certain Galois automorphisms. In 2019, Navarro, Sp&auml;th, and Vallejo proved a reduction theorem and gave an inductive condition for it. In this talk, I give the ideas for the verification of the equivariance part of the inductive condition for the Suzuki and Ree groups in non-defining characteristic.

    </li>    
<li><b>Caroline Lassueur</b> [TU Kaiserslautern]<br>
    <em>Title:</em> <b>On the trivial source character tables of \(\text{SL}_2(q)\)</b>
   <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>:</em> 
       Trivial source modules play an important r&ocirc;le in block theory, for example in the description of various equivalences between block algebras. A remarkable property of these modules lies in the fact that they lift from positive characteritic to characteristic zero and hence can be studied through ordinary characters.
       The trivial source character table (also called species table of the trivial source ring) contains a lot of information about these modules and their associoated Brauer quotients. I will discuss recent results about these for the infinite family of finite groups \(\text{SL}_2(q)\) over a large enough field \(k\) of positive characteristic \(\ell\) via block-theoretical and character-theoretical methods. This is joint work with Niamh Farrell and Bernhard B&ouml;hmler.
    </div><br>
    </li>  
<li><b>Yanjun Liu</b> [Jiangxi Normal University/TU Kaiserslautern]<br>
    <em>Title:</em> <b>Higher Frobenius-Schur indicators</b><br>
    <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>:</em> 
       Similarly to the Frobenius-Schur indicator of irreducible characters, we consider higher Frobenius-Schur indicators of generalized characters of a finite group with respect to a prime power. It turns out that these invariants give answers to interesting questions in representation theory. In particular, we give several characterizations of groups via higher Frobenius-Schur indicators. This is a joint work with W. Willems. 
    </div><br>
    </li>
<li><b>Frank L&uuml;beck</b> [RWTH Aachen]<br />
    <em>Title:</em> <b>Standardization of finite fields and their cyclic subgroups</b>
    <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>:</em> Many computer algebra systems use Conway polynomials to define not too big finite fields. In such cases it is easy to exchange data about finite fields between systems. Furthermore, Conway polynomials are used for the computation of explicit Brauer characters of representations of finite groups in prime characteristic. Unfortunately, it is practically impossible to compute any Conway polynomials which are not already known while for applications it would be desirable to know them.<br>
    In this talk I will sketch a proposal for a different standardization of finite fields with some nice properties. Furthermore standardized generators of cyclic (multiplicative) subgroups can be defined. Using these proposed definitions both applications mentioned above could be extended to a significantly wider range of finite fields in practice.

    <em>Title:</em> <b>Nilpotent pieces of Lie algebras of type \(\text{G}_2\) and \(\text{F}_4\) in bad characteristic</b>
    <div class="infos0"><em><b>Abstract</b>:</em> Let \(G\) be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field \(k\), and let \(mfg\) be its Lie algebra. The partition of the unipotent variety of \(G\) defined by George Lusztig in his papers <em>Unipotent elements in small characteristic I-IV</em> is very useful when working with representations of \(G\). Alternatively, one can consider certain subsets of the nilpotent variety of \(mfg\) called pieces. This approach also appears in <em>Unipotent elements in small characteristic III</em> where the pieces in good characteristic (for all types) and for classical groups (in every characteristic) have already been computed.<br>
    However, it is not yet known what the pieces for the exceptional groups \(G_2,F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8\) in bad characteristic are and whether they form a partition of the nilpotent variety as is the case in good characteristic.<br>
    This talk will give an introduction to the theory of the nilpotent pieces and give some context for the unknown cases. Moreover, the solution for the pieces in type \(G_2\) and \(F_4\) in bad characteristic will be presented.

                <em>Title:</em> <b>Extensions of cuspidal characters</b> <br />
                <em>Abstract:</em><div class="infos0">We prove an equivariant version of an old statement of Lusztig and Geck, that states that all cuspidal characters of a Levi subgroup have an extension to their stabilizer inside the normalizer of the Levi subgroup. We apply that result and determine the stabilizers of characters of Spin groups in their automorphism group. At the end of the talk we outline the consequences of this result towards Jordan decomposition and the McKay conjecture.

                <em>Abstract:</em><div class="infos0">Let \(G\) be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field \(k\), and let \(\mathfrak{g}\) be its Lie algebra.
The partition of the unipotent variety of \(G\) defined by Lusztig in [Lus11] is
very useful when working with representations of \(G\).
Alternatively, one can consider certain subsets of the nilpotent variety
of \(\mathfrak{g}\) called pieces. This approach also appears in [Lus11]. In good characteristic and for classical groups the definition of pieces
in [CP13] is equivalent to that of Lusztig. In these cases, it is also known that the pieces form a partition of the nilpotent variety. However, it is not yet known what the pieces for the exceptional groups
\(E_6, E_7, E_8\) in bad characteristic are, and whether the definitions of [Lus11]
and [CP13] yield the same sets in these cases.
The talk will give an introduction into the theory of the nilpotent pieces and give some context for the unknown cases.<br><br>

                <em>Abstract:</em><div class="infos0">In the representation theory of nite groups many so-called global-local conjectures have been
reduced to questions on simple groups. This was rst achieved by Issacs, Malle and Navarro
in [IMN07] for the McKay Conjecture. The Clifford theoretic key in the proof of the reduction
theorems can be described via character triples and relations among them. This idea culminated in
[Sp&auml;17] where Sp&auml;th introduced a new conjecture, called the Character Triple Conjecture (CTC),
and showed that Dade’s Projective Conjecture holds for every nite group if the CTC holds for all
quasisimple groups. Nonetheless, this new conjecture is believed to hold for every finite group. We
give new evidence to this fact by proving the Character Triple Conjecture for \(p\)-solvable groups.

                <em>Title:</em> <b>On the characters of trivial source modules</b> <br />
                <em>Abstract:</em><div class="infos0"> A central problem in the modular representation theory of finite groups is to find ways to describe and bring relevant information about the (non-simple) indecomposable modules over the group algebra. A particularly interesting class of modules is that of the trivial source modules - by definition the indecomposable direct summands of the permutation modules. These have the property to lift from positive characteristic to characteristic zero and hence can to some extent be understood through their ordinary characters. We will explain, on the one hand why decomposition matrices can be particularly useful in the computation of the characters of such modules in special cases, and on the other hand why they actually do not contain enough information, as trivial source modules are not invariant under Morita equivalences.

                <em>Abstract:</em><div class="infos0">The Galois-McKay conjecture claims that the bijection from the McKay conjecture can be chosen such that it is equivariant under certain Galois automorphisms. In 2019, Navarro, Sp&auml;th and Vallejo proved a reduction theorem for it and gave an inductive condition for the finite simple non-abelian groups. Recently, this was shown to be true for most groups of Lie type in their defining characteristic by Ruhstorfer. We will explain our ideas for the verification of the inductive condition for some of the remaining cases in defining characteristic.

the decomposition matrices of finite groups of Lie type. In this talk,
we explain a solution to this problem for the \(\Phi_{2n}\) block of
\(B_{2n}(\mathbb{F}_q)\). The computation provides the first known infinite family of
decomposition matrices in type B for blocks with non-cyclic defect
group. A similar result should also hold in type D. This is work in
